Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? The Gaming Room required a platform that could create the game for android and IOS.  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? One of the most important things in developing software is confidence so with that being said I did everything very good in preparing this documentation
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? It was helpful to know what the goal was before running blindly into a wall.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? I would add a more technical analysis in regards to an outline to the code. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? I interpreted the needs based off what the information is. It is always important to understand the costumer is always right.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? In future ventures I would use this document as a guideline and try to come as close as possible to my previous accomplishment.
